# golangconfig

`golangconfig` is a Sublime Text dependency designed to be a common API for
configuration of Go environment variables. It is intended to be used by any and
all Go-related Sublime Text packages in an effort to help reduce duplication
of user configuration.

The documentation for the package is split into two audiences:

 - [User documentation](docs/user.md) describing how to configure Sublime Text
   to properly work with your Go environment
 - [Package developer documentation](docs/package_developer.md) containing API
   documentation and instructions on how to require `golangconfig` for your
   package

Other documentation:

 - [Changelog](docs/changelog.md)
 - [License](LICENSE)
 - [Design](docs/design.md)
 - [Development](docs/development.md)
